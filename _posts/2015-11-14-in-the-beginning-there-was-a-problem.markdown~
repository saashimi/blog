In the beginning, there was a city planner-turned-(software)-developer who wanted 
to use his newfound powers to map *something.* Lacking imagination, he went back
to what he was familiar with--transit maps.  The advice, whether or not for writers
of prose or of software, was to write what you know. 

# Where's My Bus? #
As a frequent transit rider, there are already a few tools available to estimate transit vehicle locations. 


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
