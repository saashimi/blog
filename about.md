# About Me #
Give a bit of credit, I'm new at this. 

My academic background has been in [City Planning][planning] and [Geography][geography], and I started my career working for private architecture and planning firms.  Consequently, I've
been making maps for a long time, but these were static maps intended for the printed
page. I've used proprietary software from AutoDesk, ESRI, and Adobe and never used
any of the open-source tools available.  

In August 2015, I received a modest [ProStep / MISTI grant](http://www.worksystems.org/our-expertise/securing-resources/prostep) from the State of Oregon to learn software development at the [PDX Code Guild](https://pdxcodeguild.com/) in an effort at enhancing my current
skill set.

Upon completion of the program in December 2015, I'd like to continue along with
making maps and GIS/spatial analysis, but with a newfound understanding of the
software under the hood.
